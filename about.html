				<h1>FAQ</h1>
				<h2>How did the company come to be?</h2>
				<p>
					Foster Aviation and Mobile Maintenance started out of the need for
					quality aircraft maintenance at a reasonable price. Currently, there
					is a lack of qualified skilled labor in the Aviation Industry on both
					the maintenance and flight sides of the line. Our goal has, and will
					always be, to be able to meet the needs of the “little guy” who just
					wants to fly, as well as the business person traveling from A-B, and
					to do so with fairness and integrity in mind.
				</p>
				<h2>What are you up to right now?</h2>
				<p>
					Currently, we are still in the process of outfitting our new hangar
					that was purchased in Spring of 2022 in order to best meet the needs
					of our customers and staff.
				</p>
				<h2>Where do you hope to end up?</h2>
				<p>
					With the increasing customer base and need for a larger staff, we
					ultimately have plans to be able to provide the New River Valley and
					surrounding areas service for all of their maintenance and flight
					needs, including but not limited to, instruction, acquisition, and
					charter services.
