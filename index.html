						<p><strong>Clay</strong> (AKA “Shop Rat” AKA “The Gopher”) is a young A&P in training who specializes in cleaning of aircraft, parts, and keeping the shop in tip top shape. Clay recently graduated the Pulaski County Highschool as “Prom King” and currently attends New River Community College pursuing a degree in business. He participates in the “ACCE” program where, in exchange for keeping his grades up and a certain amount of volunteer work, his education is paid for in full. He’s such a go-getter!</p>

						<span class="fourth">
						<p><strong>Cash</strong> is the airport dog. He is a chow/lab mix and loves to bark at people and airplanes alike. While his bark may seem ferocious, he is nothing but a big baby and is trying to get your attention so that you will rub his head. Fair warning though, if you do pet him, you will from that point on be expected to continue petting him until you leave the premises.</p>
